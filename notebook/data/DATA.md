CSV Files
--

### rides/*
The csv files for this example are fairly large (50-100MB each).
Instead of bogging down this repository with these files,
I will leave it up you to download and extract a reason sample for local EDA with Jupyter Notebook.

These csv's contain individual ride history.

### stations/*
The single csv file in this contains information about "Bike Stations"
